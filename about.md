# About Me  
    
>***Full Stack Web Developer. Legal Technology Enthusiast. Corporate Lawyer in a former life.***

In my four years as an M&A/corporate law attorney, I developed an appreciation for how, in every corner of the provision of legal service, technology and process controls can make or break a team's productivity. From documentary redlines, drafting tools, and automated diligence analysis to NLP-driven contract intelligence and judicial precedent weighting, I am enthusiastic about the coming transformation of the legal services industry by gains in the usefulness and exponential growth in the types of legal tech available for law practitioners. At its best, legal tech promises to shoulder the most routine, repetitive tasks and to free lawyer's time for their higher calling--client advising and strategic business consultation.  

As a recently minted full-stack software engineer with a background in corporate law, I am looking forward to continuing my journey in the law + technology space. I am an experienced problem-solver who values sound process and documentation, effective communication and team-driven decisions.
