# About Me

> **_Full Stack Software Engineer. Operations Manager in a former life._**

As an operations manager, there were often many ways to tackle a problem and determining the best path to follow is a crucial skill I learned. As I’ve transitioned into software engineering I have found that skill to be very useful alongside my ability and desire to learn new things. In this field technologies, frameworks and languages are constantly evolving so continually being open to new ideas and challenges is a strength that benefits me greatly.

My time in General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp is where I developed the hard skills necessary to thrive in a software engineering. For 3 months I spent my days learning and practicing JavaScript, React, Node.Js and a few others. With that in mind, I know 3 months is not enough time to become an expert. However, what it did provide is a foundation to further expand on as a software engineer.
